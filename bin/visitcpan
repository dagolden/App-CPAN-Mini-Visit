= NAME

visitcpan - explore each distribution in a minicpan repository

= VERSION

This documentation refers to %%VERSION%%.

= SYNOPSIS

    $ visitcpan [OPTIONS] [PROGRAM]

    $ visitcpan [OPTIONS] -- [PROGRAM] [PROGRAM ARGS]

= DESCRIPTION

This program executes other programs against each distribution in a minicpan
repository.  Given a program to run, for each distribution archive in the
repository, it will:

* extract the distribution archive to a temporary directory 
* change to the temporary directory
* execute the user-specified program
* return to the original directory
* clean up the temporary directory

If no program to run is provided, {visitcpan} will instead produce a listing of
distribution files, one per line, that can be piped to other programs for
analysis.

To avoid conflicts between {visitcpan} options and arguments provided to
the program to run, use two dashes ('--') to separate minicpan options 
from other arguments.

By default, {visitcpan} will use a local minicpan repository as defined 
in a .minicpanrc file. 

= OPTIONS

 --minicpan|-m      directory of a minicpan (defaults to local minicpan 
                    from CPAN::Mini config file)

 --                 indicates the end of options for visitcpan

 --help|-h          this usage info 

 --version|-V       visitcpan program version
